ESP32 Marauder C5 wiring diagram 
For this exact project I utilized an Espressif ESP32-C5-WROOM-1 (MCN8R4), ATGM366H(GPS), Micro SD Card reader, a protoboard from AWOK Dynamics, and GPS antenna (HA-201 or HA-103). I made this because I kept seeing people in the Discords ask about it and thought this may help for all you visual learners.
Something to note, just pay attention to the pinouts. At the time i bought this devkit this was the only one available and pinouts might differ.
